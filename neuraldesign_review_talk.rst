Book review: Principles of Neural Design
========================================
.. note::
   The idea of the talk was to present a PDF viewer showing the annotated book and enter
   appropriate pages during the talk/discussion. I am working with page numbers
   from the PDF viewer, where
   
   page number in the PDF view = page number in the book + 25.
   
   Get in contact to get my annotated/highlighted PDF (not in the GitHub repository for copyright reasons, different versions may count pages differently).

Motivation for the book
-----------------------
- **Idea**: Wade through the mountains of data to understand how nervous systems are optimized to process information at all scales

- **More details**: summary, to be found on `Goodreads <https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23582015-principles-of-neural-design>`_. (*open link, talk about 50k neuroscientists, "this is the first number, there are a lot"*)

- **Take a physics approach to neuroscience**
(Rutherford quote: "All science is either physics or stamp-collecting")

.. not done here: discuss sociological differences between neuroscience and physics
.. e.g. for neuroscientists, doing experiments is apparently higher-status, while for physicists, explaining them is

What are the design principles?
-------------------------------
*open, discuss page 470, 471*

How is the brain optimal?/My view on this
-----------------------------------------
- Example of principle "Adapt, match, learn and forget"
- **Page 286/figure 9.11:** One highlighted piece of "evidence for optimality": Time response of LMC - large monopolar cell - in fly's visual system maximizes the transmitted information, if one models the natural scenes as randomly picking intensities of certain frequencies according to predefined power density
- This is quite impressive, as it shows functional optimization (i.e. optimization of a function) in the brain
- But it also displays the book's weaknesses:

  - They say the LMC coding scheme is "optimal", but it's optimal only when modelling natural scenes as "videos whose Fourier transforms are drawn randomly"; videos randomly generated like that would not look like natural scenes
  - JPEG (or more recent HEIF) would presumably compress better
  - TODO: It would be interesting to generate "natural scenes" by a power distribution as in the book;

- **Page 284/figure 9.11** is a different illustration of LMC's "optimality"; same discussion possible here; highlighted text in page 285 explains biological mechanism

Structure and content of the book
---------------------------------
*open page 8*

  - **Chapter 10** would fit in this succession as well: discusses how analogue signals are recoded to pulsatile for transmission over distances bigger than 1 mm

- **Chapters 8-12:** Trace flow of optical information through a nervous system, from the environment to the brain, also brief excursions to other senses (TODO link to the example for auditory receptors)

Talk/Book review: Principles of neural design
=============================================

- *go to page 470*: This is a compact representation of the design principles
- highlight: *go to page 95*: Large monopolar cell optimizes tempo

- *go to page 8, talk about organization*

Noteworthy things about the book
--------------------------------

- Focus on vision
- Focus on small scale/early stages of information processing
- not that much about higher brain functions
- I liked: lots of numbers everywhere

Criticism:
----------
- my main criticism: Pro-brain bias
- *Go to page 14, look at first paragraph of introduction*

  - They talk about how the brain is "optimal", and the resulting functionality is much better than that of computers, everywhere
  - But I'd say it's optimal under the very severe constraints of computing with proteins in water, which yield lots of drawbacks:
    
    - everything works in milliseconds instead of nanoseconds
    - high noise
    - structures are not very reliable compared to silicon...
    - at least doesn't really use sophisticated algorithms (e.g. 
    - ... (see also rest of the talk, examples: vestibular)
  
  - Downstream, there are absolutely things humans can't do as well as computers:
    
    - quickly remembering lots of data
    - multiplying numbers
    - estimating a distance or time/staying in the middle of the lane...
  
  - So computing with proteins in water is like travelling to China on Pogo sticks: Very impressive if someone can make it, but not a superior alternative to a plane

  - Don't clearly distinguish between qualitative and quantitative evidence for optimization
  

computers being compared with are outdated

sometimes don't know where numbers come from

sometimes the physics seemed inaccurate/incorrect to me where I could check it

can still contain details, sometimes a bit verbose for my taste/too much rambling about life/philosophy?

joke: they could have "sent only what is needed"

a   
not clear if reducing spike rate is really the point, after all, we also want to do the computations some time, and maybe that's the point!

(often talks about maximizing information, but actual thing to maximize is value-of-information...)

Chapter 2: Information processing in simple organisms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- **Page 39/Figure 2.2:** Mechanism by which E. coli processes information about glucose/lactose concentration in environment; only synthesizes lactase if no glucose, but lactase

- *go to page 41/figure 2.3*
- **Page 40:** 1 second memory of receptors for chemotaxis (biased random walk) to find food

- **Page 44-48/Figure 2.4:** look at Paramecium (larger bacterium):

  - **Page 44:** volume 300,000 times higher, moves 50 times faster than E. coli (1400 Âµm/sec)
  - Retracts when ramming an obstacle
  - Mechanism for this: Electrical signalling/Polarization of the membrane, ion pumps
  - Diffusion of signalling molecules would be too slow for this retraction too work quickly enough
  - Conversely, E. Coli is too small to implement such a mechanism

- **Page 46-64:** C. elegans, small worm with nervous system
  
  - *Go to page 48/figure 2.5*: This is the worm
  - **page 50 in text, but described by figure 2.5:** Body plays a role in computing cyclical movement, "embodied computation"
    
    - claims 'revolution' for robots, but haven't looked into extent to which it is important today
  
  - **Page 53/Figure 2.7:** Circuit for avoidance
  - **Page 56/Figure 2.8:** Social behaviour; this is controlled by 1 neuron/1 peptide, TODO I didn't really understand what the neuron does
  - **Page 57:** Learning.

    - "For example, NaCl (salt) normally attracts worms, but when a worm has been starved in the presence of salt for only 10 minutes, it later avoids salt."

    - done by chemical computing (e.g. strength of chemotaxis by odorant is learned depending on whether odorant is associated with food)

  - **Page 60f, subsection "Conserves synapses":** Design principle: to save energy per accuracy, send as slowly as possible

  - **Page 61, subsection "Minimizes wiring costs/Page 62, figure 2.9:** the prerogative "minimize wiring costs" predicts position of "90 % of neurons", but I don't know how "position" is defined exactly (spatially vs. topologically etc.)

  - **Page 62, lower part, subsection "Favors analogue over pulsatile":** C. Elegans doesn't need spiking neurons because it's not bigger than 1 mm, more expensive spiking neurons not necessary

Chapter 3: Larger brains
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- **Page 67f/Figure 3.1:** Similarities between mouse+fly brain

- **Following pages in text:** Lots of writing about how brain anticipates demands/changing circumstances in body and world and acts upon it

- **Page 76, figure 3.5; also page 77, figure 3.6 - calculated in page 76f, subsection "A neuron's information capacity":** Sets up terms of trade for spiking neurons: bits/spike, ATP/spike, bits/ATP.
  
  - Maybe most important figures in the whole book
  - Referred to over and over again in the book to explain why something is set up in a certain way
  - Axon diameter proportional to average spike rate
  - Axon volume rises as spike rate^2
  - **Explanation in page 79:** This is due to constant energy per spike, constant mitochondrial volume
  - I didn't really understand "measured bits per spike" in figure 3.5, lower. Did they look at an optimal compression scheme? Is this even possible?
  - Design principles inspired by this:
  
    - Send only what is needed
    - Send at the lowest acceptable rate
    - Minimize wire, i.e. axons/dendrites (this refers to volume, not only length). Chapter 13 is an entire chapter on efficient wiring!
 
- **Writing page 83** anabolism (being asleep) vs catabolism (being awake)

- Wired vs. wireless communication:

  - **Page 85/Figure 4.1:** Brain part "SCN", "suprachiasmatic nucleus", has about 8.6k neurons in humans, includes "master clock" for whole body's sleep-wake cycle
  - **Page 91f/Figure 4.3:** Higher-level overview over communication between brain and body

- **Writing page 86:** Hypothalamus sends simple instructions, can be said to be driver of ultimate decision making
  
  - **Writing page 87:** Well-understood enough that a cat can be made to behave in particular ways by stimulating regions of Hypothalamus
  - Joke: ultimage decision-making comes from the hypothalamus and not the prefrontal cortex!
  - very fine fibers, slow signals, low energy consumption (still page 87)
  - **Compare page 121:** Analogue is central complex in insects, stimulating one neuron induces fighting behaviour as well etc.

- **Page 94/Figure 4.4:** Rat brain, TODO where is hippocampus?

- **Writing page 95:** pattern generators in spinal column demonstrates principle "What fires together, locates together" (part of "minimize wire")

- **Writing page 98:** Investment into certain senses/frequencies/wavelengths depends on important stimuli for animals

  - Example: Bat ultrasound works at up to 180 kHz - but I don't know how this is biologically possible or works

(fig 102: mormyrid has much bigger cerebellum because of high-frequency electrical signalling)

 also speech low frequency

END NEXT CYCLE
 Dissonance sensation is a result of brain's response to unusual or rare sound perceptions (Pankovski and Pankovska 2017). The brain is remembering and ranking the sound patterns that usually enters the ears, and if an unusual (rare occurring) sound is listened to, a well known EEG pattern emerges (P300/P3b) indicating an oddball event. This causes slight stress in the listener, which is causing the sensation of dissonance. In the same paper, Pankovski and Pankovska show by a software simulated neural network that the brain is capable of such remembering and ranking of the sound patterns, thus perfectly reproducing the well known Helmholtz's list of two-tone intervals ordered by consonance/dissonance, for the first time in the history of studying these phenomena. As a consequence, Pankovski and Pankovska suggest that the consonance and dissonance are biologically dependent for the more consonant sounds, and culturally dependent for the more dissonant sounds.

 104: sample densely with one part of the sense, not densely with the rest (fovea, homunculus etc), 
 
 106: superior colliculus connects retinal map with motor map directly to drive eye to location of interest,
 generally: filter out stuff, similarly: locusts shut of ear when they are chirping
 
 107: corollary discharge: colliculus tells eye has been moved, so that rest of brain can compensate, compensation occurs "frontal eye field" in the front of the brain (after low-level eye processing has occured), this is done even though wire is very long (107 seems to imply that command where to look also comes from there? TODO seems unclear)
 also insects

that were thought, until recently, to be confined to monkeys, human, dolphin, and pigeon (Srinivasan, 2010; Menzel, 2012), but I don't know what this is

insect's small size of brain can apparently be much more efficient per neuron, capacity grows sublinearly

(JOKE: just as we know in academia and HPC)

128 embodied computation: 10 Hz spikes enable 200 Hz wing-beat of drosophilia thanks to resonance, legs are yanked straight by same muscle that starts the wings -> fly jumps+

- **Page 190/Figure 7.5:** receptor clusters much smaller for fast auditory cells didn't understand but why smaller not bigger?

- **Writing page 192/193:** various receptors and timescales

  - AMPA is fast
  - NMDA with glutamate unbinds on a timescale of 100 ms, works for coincidence detection
  - mGLuR is even slower (tens of seconds)

fly photoreceptor reduces transduction proteins when it gets brighter (img 246)

247ff space/energy efficiency of fly photoreceptors: fly is faster but consumes more energy because it opens channels when light influx, BUT didn't yet understand why

A blowfly
resting in sunlight uses 8% of its energy to power electrical currents in pho-
toreceptors.

250 Three factors reduce a fly photoreceptorâ s efficiency. First, transduction
has intrinsically low quantum efficiency, because cylindrical microvilli
pack rhodopsin less efficiently than the rodâ s flat discs and the coneâ s folded
membranes. Second, signals amplified by positive feedback are noisier.
Therefore, to achieve a given sensitivity and S/N, a fly photoreceptor must
be larger. A larger neuron draws more current, and this increases energy
cost. Third, and most significant, the flyâ s one-type-fits-all design is inher-
ently inefficient.

img 257 different insects with different speeds have different photoreceptor reaction, but I don't understand why blowfly has greater bandwidth with sustained photoreceptor reaction

Conclusion (chapter 15)

fly + human brain have evolved in parallel, evolved same efficiency, so it seems that the brain already achieved an optimum of some sort

chapter 12:
noise when discriminating dark spot entirely at retinal output

page 284: exact degree of coupling appears to maximize total information from the array (Design of a Trichromatic Cone Array)

302: Could a cell then continue to improve its S/N by extending its dendrites
ever farther to collect more synapses? No. Spatial correlations decline expo-
nentially across natural scenes whereas S/N improves only as the square
root of added synapses.

don't like the lack of quantitative results, it's not made clear if something is qualitative or quantitative
